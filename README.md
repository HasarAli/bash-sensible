# sensible.bash

An attempt at saner Bash defaults. Inspired by Tim Pope's [sensible.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible).

## The config

`sensible.bash` is intended to be a simple starting point to enjoy a better Bash experience out of the box. The file has three sections.

### Smarter tab completion

Options to improve on Bash's default tab completion. These settings get Bash to:

- Perform file completion in a case insensitive fashion;
- Treat hyphens and underscores as equivalent;
- Display matches for ambiguous patterns at the first press of the tab key (instead of requiring two tab-presses).

### Sane history defaults

Some tweakings to the command history, mostly taken from Tom Ryder's article [Better Bash History](http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/better-bash-history/). These options will get Bash to:

- Append to the history file, instead of overwriting it;
- Save multi-line commands as one command;
- Record each line as it gets issued;
- Keep track of a bigger history;
- Avoid duplicate entries;
- Avoid recording unneeded commands (`exit`, `ls`, `bg`, `fg`, and `history` itself);
- Make use of a timestamp format that is actually useful.

### Better, directory navigation

Options to make file system navigation blazingly fast:

- Prepend cd to directory names automatically, so you can `cd` into directories just by typing their name;
- Automatically correct spelling errors during tab-completion;
- Automatically correct spelling errors in arguments supplied to `cd`;
- **`CDPATH`** defines where `cd` will look for targetsâ€”the default is the current working directory, but you can add directories you want to have fast access to (ex: `projects`, `repos`, `documents`...)
- **`cdable_vars`** allows you to define paths as variables and `cd` into it from wherever you are in the file system, kind of like a bookmarking system for Bash.

Refer to the comments in `sensible.bash`  to learn more. I also wrote an [article](http://mrzool.cc/writing/sensible-bash/) where I explain each option in detail.

## Usage

You can either copy `sensible.bash` in your `bashrc` or cherry-pick the options you like most from it, but the fastest way to get started is probably to source it from the top of your `bashrc`:

```bash
if [ -f ~/bin/sensible.bash ]; then
   source ~/bin/sensible.bash
fi
```

#### Note for OS X users

If you're using OS X, I recommend to follow [Josh Staiger's advice](http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html) and source `bashrc` from `bash_profile` so to keep all your configuration in one place.
